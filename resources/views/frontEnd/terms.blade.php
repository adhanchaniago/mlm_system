        <h4>PREAMBLE</h4>
        The present Terms and Conditions of Sale define and regulate the contractual relation between the
        Merchant and you, the Customer, also defined below as the user of the Website.
        The present Terms and Conditions of Sale apply exclusively between the Merchant and any person who
        visits the Website or makes a purchase from the Website.
        You have access to and may become familiar with the Terms and Conditions of Sale directly on the
        Website. These Terms and Conditions of Sale may be altered at any point in time, at the discretion of
        the Merchant. Enforceable terms and conditions consist those published on the Website, binding as of
        their date of registration. At all times, you are solely responsible for remaining knowledgeable about,
        and in compliance with, these Terms & Conditions of Sale.
        Your failure to cancel your Account, or cease to use the Merchant’s ecommerce solutions affected by the
        amendment will constitute your tacit acceptance of the amended terms. If you don’t agree to the
        amendments or to any of the terms in this Agreement, your only remedy is to cancel your Account or to
        cease to use the Merchant’s ecommerce solutions. The Merchant shall not have any obligation to refund
        any fees that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation of your Account or cessation of use
        of any Subscription, nor shall the Merchant have any obligation to prorate any fees in such
        circumstances.
        The information given on the said Website may be modified by the Merchant without prior notification.
        The simple act of placing an order on the Website implies acceptance, without reserve, of the present
        Terms and Conditions of Sale.
        <h4>Scope of this agreement</h4>
        The deployment and management (“Services“) of wireless beacons (“Products”), is governed solely by this
        Agreement and other documents which may be executed by the Parties in this regard.
        <h4>User Account</h4>
        To make a purchase on the Merchant’s branded-ecommerce Store, you may complete the Store’s registration
        process, and create a Store account (“Account”). All members must be 13 years or older to create an
        account on the Store. Your Account may also include billing information you provide to the Merchant for
        the purchase of Subscriptions, for pre-orders or for faster future purchases. You are solely responsible
        for all activity on your Account and for the security of your computer system. You may not reveal, share
        or otherwise allow others to use your password or Account. You agree that you are personally responsible
        for the use of your password and Account and for all of the communication and activity on the Store that
        results from use of your login name and password. You may not sell or charge others for the right to use
        your Account, or otherwise transfer your Account, nor may you sell, charge others for the right to use,
        or transfer any Subscriptions other than if and as expressly permitted by these Terms of Sale.
        Please inform us immediately if you have any reason to believe that your password has become known to
        anyone else, or if the password is being, or is likely to be used in an unauthorized manner.
        As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all
        purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family or friends. If you cancel
        your Account, the Merchant reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred before
        cancellation. Any delinquent or unpaid Accounts must be settled before the Merchant can allow you to
        register again.
        You also understand and acknowledge that Accounts are user rights binding you to such an Account, and
        that the Merchant does not recognize any transfer of Accounts (including transfers by operation of law)
        from one subscriber to any third party. Each customer shall be the sole holder of his own Account.
        Your purchase is subject to product requirements which you must read before purchasing a product. The
        act of making a purchase constitutes your tacit understanding and compliance with these requirements.
        The Merchant shall not be held responsible for any loss, incompatible or erroneous purchases. We
        encourage you to contact our customer services, in such an event, so we may resolve your problem to the
        best of our ability.
        You agree that you will be personally responsible for the use of your Account and for all activity on
        the Store that results from use of your Account. Your online conduct is expected to be in good faith,
        non-abusive and seeking any other personal interest other than the services provided. You will otherwise
        be held in contempt and, at the discretion of the Merchant, ensuing legal procedure may incur.
        You may cancel your Account at any time. You may cease use of an Account at any time or, if you choose,
        you may request that we terminate your access to an Account. However, Accounts and product delivery are
        not transferable and product purchase transactions entitle you to a single right to the delivery of a
        product. Your cancellation of an Account will not entitle you to any refund for any products or fees.
        The Merchant holds the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred prior to the cancellation of
        your Account. In addition, you are responsible for any charges incurred to third-party vendors or
        content providers before your cancellation.
        The Merchant may cancel your Account at any time, in the event that
        <ol>
            <li>(a) the Merchant closes down the Store, or</li>
            <li>(b) you breach any terms of this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use).</li>
        </ol>
        In the event that your Account is terminated or cancelled by the Merchant for a violation of these Terms
        of Sale or improper or illegal activity, no refund, including of any Subscription fees or of any unused
        funds in your Account, will be granted.
        Stock Availability and Sales Fulfilment
        Products are for sale within the limit of available stock. Offers for Products that are out of stock
        shall be valid on the condition that they can be obtained from the Merchant’s suppliers. The Merchant
        shall grant a limited license of access and use of the Website. The processing and delivery of orders
        shall always be honored upon availability of stock.
        <h4>Application</h4>
        Your Order is a binding offer to the Merchant to purchase the said Services and Products. Upon the
        placement of an order an ensuing and immediate confirmation message will be displayed followed by a
        confirmation email to you. Such automatic confirmation does not constitute an acceptance by the Merchant
        of your order, but a notice of acknowledgement. The Merchant’s acceptance of your order shall occur and
        a contract shall form only once the Merchant approves the order. We only accept your offer, and conclude
        the contract of sale for a product ordered by you, when we dispatch the product to you and send e-mail
        confirmation to you that we’ve dispatched the product to you (the “Fulfillment Confirmation E-mail”).
        If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive a separate Dispatch Confirmation
        E-mail for each package, and each Fulfillment Confirmation E-mail and corresponding dispatch will
        conclude a separate contract of sale between us for the product(s) specified in that Fulfillment
        Confirmation E-mail. Your contract is with the Merchant.
        <h3>Orders and Use of the Services</h3>
        The orders shall be placed exclusively via the Internet.
        Automatic order confirmation errors may occur. Please check the automatic order confirmation for errors
        and inform us immediately of any discrepancies. You guarantee all data provided during registration is
        true, accurate, up-to-date and complete. Orders will only be accepted from Customers 13 years of age and
        older.
        The Merchant holds the right to cancel or refuse any order from a Customer with whom a previous order’s
        payment litigation is being resolved.
        You consent to receive sales invoices electronically. For each delivery, in our Fulfillment Confirmation
        E-mail you will receive a link to your electronic invoice on the Website. If you do not have an account
        and have not printed your invoice upon receiving your Fulfillment Confirmation Email, or for further
        information about electronic invoices and instructions on how to receive a paper copy please contact our
        customer support.
        <h3>Delivery of Physical goods</h3>
        Once the payment pursuant to an Order is duly completed, your order shall be delivered to the address
        indicated during the ordering procedure and begin providing Services. The delivery delay indicated on
        the Website is strictly indicative and may vary with the progression of the order. The Merchant cannot
        be held responsible for delayed delivery or the loss of a package by postal services or couriers and
        ensuing consequences. It is your responsibility to verify the good condition of their package(s) and its
        content upon receiving the package. In the event the package(s) or content are not in conformity with
        the order, you shall put in writing a full description of the content and disconformities, on the
        delivery slip, and shall issue a letter, with an acknowledgement of receipt and similar in content,
        within 3 days of reception.
        Payment
        At the time of purchase, you will have the possibility to pay with all displayed payment methods. Any
        other methods will not be endorsed.
        The Merchant uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology for your transactions. Your banking
        information is not stored by the Merchant. Stored banking information is stored by the Payment Service
        Provider, only if you have selected the option of saving a credit/debit card to your name, for a future
        use during check out or for a pre-order. Therefore, the Merchant does not have access to private banking
        details and credit history at any point. To prevent abuses and fraud, the Merchant only stores your
        address and the transaction time and date. This data remains strictly confidential.
        Any attempted fraud or deception, regardless of scope, will immediately lead to further action, as part
        of which all related transaction data might be forwarded to the authorities.
        When you provide payment information to the Merchant or to one of its payment service providers, you
        establish that you are the authorized user of the card, PIN, key or account associated with that
        payment, and you authorize the Merchant to charge your credit card or to process your payment with the
        chosen third-party payment service provider for any purchases or fees chargeable to your account. The
        Merchant may require you to provide your address or other information in order to meet the Merchant’s
        obligations under applicable tax law.
        For subscriptions purchased, based on an agreed usage period, where recurring payments are made in
        exchange for continued use (“Recurring Payment Subscriptions”), by continuing to use the Recurring
        Payment Subscription, you agree and reaffirm that the Merchant is authorized to charge your credit card,
        or to process your payment with any other applicable third-party payment processor (such as Paypal), for
        any applicable recurring payment amounts. If you have purchased any Recurring Payment Subscriptions, you
        agree to notify the Merchant promptly of any changes to your credit card account number, its expiration
        date and/or your billing address, or your PayPal or other payment account number, and you agree to
        notify the Merchant promptly if your credit card or PayPal or other payment account expires or is
        canceled for any reason.
        The term of the Service Agreement will be non-cancellable for two months. Following the initial two
        month term, the Services are automatically renewed for one month terms. The Agreement can be terminated
        with one (1) month’s written notice AND the return of the Products in proper working order. The Lease
        Term will continue on a month to month basis thereafter until the Customer gives Samy Bot 30 days
        written cancellation notice and the return of the Products. The Customer shall pay for an Order by
        credit card. The Customer will submit the credit card payment details at the time the Order is placed.
        The Customer’s credit card will be immediately charged for the first and last month’s use of Products
        and each month thereafter during the Term.
        If your use of the Store and purchases are subject to any type of use or sales tax, then the Merchant
        may also charge you for those taxes, in addition to the Subscription or other fees published in the
        Rules of Use.
        You agree that you will not use IP proxying or other methods to disguise the place of your residence,
        whether to circumvent geographical restrictions on Product content, to purchase at pricing not
        applicable to your geography, or for any other purpose. If you do this, we may terminate your access to
        your Account.
        <h4>Ownership Rights</h4>
        Should you not honor the payment obligations for any reason whatsoever, the Merchant shall be entitled
        to demand that the delivered merchandise be returned immediately, at your own cost, risk and peril.
        The Merchant makes no representations or warranties, either expressed or implied, regarding any third
        party site. In particular, the Merchant makes no representation or warranty that any service or
        subscription offered via third-party vendors will not change or be suspended or terminated.
        <h4>Warranty Disclaimer</h4>
        SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, THE MERCHANT DOES NOT MAKE, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY WARRANTY OR
        REPRESENTATION WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
        TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY,
        RELIABILITY, AND NON‐INFRINGEMENT. FURTHER, THE MERCHANT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE
        PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE OR THAT THE PRODUCTS WILL MEET CUSTOMER’S OR
        ANY THIRD PARTY’S EXPECTATIONS.

        any person other than the parties to these Terms of Sale.
        When you use the Merchant Websites, you may also be using the services of one or more third parties,
        such as a payment service provider. Your use of these third party services may be subject to the
        separate policies, terms of use, and fees of these third parties. We advise you to refer to these third
        parties’ policies.
        You acknowledge that you connect to the Website and use its services at your own risk. The Merchant
        holds no responsibility for any direct or indirect damages a user or a third party may suffer for any
        reason whatsoever by connecting to the Website, not having access or being able to log in to the
        Website, or that the Website is or is not working. The Merchant guarantees it shall take all sensible
        measures to ensure the availability of its services. However, since the transactions are made via the
        Internet, the Merchant cannot guarantee the quality of the networks outside of its offices. Technical
        interruptions are possible. The Merchant shall attempt to inform its Customers of the reasons for an
        interruption, to the best of its ability, but holds no responsibility in the event of a delay. The
        Merchant holds no responsibility in the event of any loss of your data provided. Customers must always
        keep a personal copy of files. The Merchant holds no responsibility for not honoring its contractual
        obligations, in the event of chance occurrence, unavoidable accident or an Act of God as defined by the
        laws and precedents of the applicable jurisdictions.
        Nor in any event will the Merchant be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special,
        punitive or exemplary damages, or any other damages arising out of or in any way connected with the
        store, the software, and any information available in connection therewith, or inability to use the
        software, subscriptions or any information, even in the event of the Merchant’s or its affiliates’
        fault, tort (including negligence), strict liability, breach of contract, or breach of the Merchant’s
        warranty and even if the Merchant has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations
        and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate recompense.
        You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Merchant, its licensors, and its and their
        affiliates from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that arise from or in
        connection with breach of these Terms of Sale or the use of the Store, by you or any person(s) using
        your Account, or from the Product selection to the creation of an Account, the purchase, distribution,
        promotion and use of any add-ons or derivative Products. The Merchant holds the right, at its own
        expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification
        by you. In that event, you shall have no further obligation to provide indemnification to the Merchant
        in that matter. This section regarding responsibilities shall survive termination of these Terms of
        Sale.
        If you provide the Merchant with any feedback or suggestions about the Store, or any Merchant’s
        software, products or services, the Merchant is free to use the feedback or suggestions however it
        chooses, without any obligation to account to you.
        The Merchant and its affiliates will not be responsible for
        <ol>
            <li>(i) losses that were not caused by any breach on our part, or </li>
            <li>(ii) any indirect or consequential losses that were not foreseeable to both you
                and us when the contract for the sale of products by us to you was formed.
                The Merchant may inform you through an online notice in the case of systems’ maintenance, and shall not
                be held responsible for any incurring ensuing delays or consequences.</li>

        <h4>Applicable Law – Competent Jurisdiction</h4>
        BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR
        CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, THE MERCHANT, ITS LICENSORS, AND
        ITS AND THEIR AFFILIATES’ LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
        You agree that these Terms of Sale shall be deemed to have been made and executed in the Province of
        Ontario, and any dispute arising hereunder shall be resolved in accordance with the law of Ontario,
        Canada. Subject to Dispute Resolution by Arbitration below, you agree that any claim asserted in any
        legal proceeding by you against the Merchant shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in Ontario,
        having subject matter jurisdiction with respect to the dispute between the parties and you hereby
        consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. In any dispute arising under these Terms of Sale,
        the prevailing party will be entitled to attorneys’ fees and expenses.
        Nothing in these Terms of Sale limits or excludes our responsibility for fraudulent representations made
        by us or for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct.
        If any of these Terms of Sale is deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition
        will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.
        If you breach these Terms of Sale and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and
        remedies in any other situation where you breach these Conditions of Sale.
        <h4>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY ARBITRATION</h4>
        Most user concerns can be resolved by use of our support at support@Samy Bot.com. If we are unable to
        resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and us, this section explains how we agree to
        resolve it.
        YOU AND THE MERCHANT AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING
        ARBITRATION. THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO:
        <ol>
            <li>(i) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US;</li>
            <li>(ii) THIS AGREEMENT; OR</li>
            <li>(iii) YOUR USE OF THE STORE, YOUR ACCOUNT
                OR THE MERCHANT SOFTWARE.</li>
        </ol>
        IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT,
        STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.
        However, this Section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or the
        Merchant may bring in any court with jurisdiction:
        <ol>
            <li>(i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking
                injunctive relief; and</li>
            <li>(ii) claims related
                to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy or theft.</li>
        </ol>
        This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or
        local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you.
        Arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration
        is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules
        than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a
        written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
        YOU AND THE MERCHANT ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.
        You and the Merchant agree to make reasonable efforts, in good faith, to informally resolve any dispute
        before initiating arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a
        written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief
        sought. If you and the Merchant do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30
        days after the notice is received, you or the Merchant may commence arbitration. Written notice to the
        Merchant must be sent via postal mail.
        YOU AND THE MERCHANT AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE
        ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION. The ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE
        INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. You and the
        Merchant also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration with any other action or
        arbitration without the consent of all parties to this Agreement and all other actions or arbitrations.
        If the agreement in this section not to bring or participate in a class or representative action,
        private attorney general action or collective arbitration should be found illegal or unenforceable, you
        and the Merchant agree that it shall not be severable, that this entire section shall be unenforceable
        and any claim or dispute would be resolved in court and not in collective arbitration.
        Notwithstanding this Section, you have the right to litigate any dispute in small claims court, if all
        the requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at
        issue in the dispute, are satisfied.
        These terms shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If the laws of your
        jurisdiction prohibit the application of some or all of the provisions, of this section alone, such
        provisions will not apply to you.
        Except as otherwise expressly stipulated in these Terms of Sale, in the event that any provision of
        these Terms of Sale shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be
        unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining
        portions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Sale, the Merchant’s
        Privacy Policy and the Members Programs Terms and Conditions constitute and contain the entire agreement
        between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written
        agreements.
        If you believe that your rights are being infringed, please contact us. We respond expeditiously to
        rights owners and their agents to communicate concerns about any alleged infringement.
        Upon receipt of your infringement notice we may take certain actions, including removing information or
        an item, all of which are taken without any admission as to liability and without prejudice to any
        rights, remedies or defenses, for all of which we hold an unmitigated discretion to execute.
        Furthermore, by submitting an infringement notice, you grant the Merchant the right to use, reproduce,
        modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, and display its content throughout the
        world in any media. This includes forwarding your infringement notice to the parties involved in the
        provision of the allegedly infringing content. You agree to indemnify the Merchant for all claims
        brought by a third party against the Merchant arising out of or in connection with the submission of
        your infringement notice.
        <h4>Customs</h4>
        You agree to comply with all applicable import/export laws and regulations. You agree not to export the
        Product or allow use of your Account by individuals of situated in a country subject to an embargo or
        prohibition of any form from the US government, the European Union or NATO. You represent and warrant
        that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited
        country.
        When ordering products from the Merchant for delivery outside of the USA you may be subject to import
        duties and taxes, which are levied once the package reaches the specified destination. Any additional
        charges for customs clearance must be borne by you; we have no control over these charges. Customs
        policies vary widely from country to country, so you should contact your local customs office for
        further information. Additionally, please note that, you are considered the importer of record and must
        comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the products. Your
        privacy is important to us and we would like our international customers to be aware that cross-border
        deliveries are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities.

        <h4>3. FTC Endorsement Compliance</h4>
        It is the intent of Samy Bot to treat our customers fairly and to comply fully with all Federal Trade
        Commission regulations related to advertising. As such, we require our affiliates to comply with these
        regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, Federal Trade Commission 16 CFR Part 255: Guides
        Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, which requires, among other
        criteria, that material connections between advertisers and endorsers be disclosed. This means that
        directories, review/rating sites, blogs and other websites, email or collateral that purport to provide
        an endorsement or assessment of an advertiser (in this case Samy Bot) must prominently disclose the fact
        financial or in-kind compensation is provided from the advertiser.
        Samy Bot reserves the right to withhold commission fees and cancel the affiliate relationship with you
        should we determine, at our discretion, that you are not in compliance with the previously mentioned
        guide or other FTC regulations/guides we deem relevant.
        <h4>4. Order Processing</h4>
        We will process orders placed by Referred Customers. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to
        reject orders that do not comply with certain requirements that we may establish from time to time. All
        aspects of order processing and fulfillment, including Samy Bot service, cancellation, processing,
        refunds and payment processing will be our responsibility. We will track the Qualified Purchases and
        will make this information available to you.

        <h4>5. Commission Determination</h4>
        Under the Affiliate Program, you will be paid for Qualified Purchases by Referred Customers that you
        refer to Samy Bot under and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and as described in greater
        detail in Schedule 1. Each Referred Customer and each Qualified Purchase must meet the following
        criteria (the “Criteria”):<br>
        5.1 Each Referred Customer must be a new and unique visitor to Samy Bot and must register using a valid
        and unique account and billing information and must agree to our Terms & Conditions.<br>
        5.2 Each Referred Customer must make a Qualified Purchase, and provide a valid payment for the purchased
        Samy Bot Products or Services. To generate a Commission Fee for you, each Referred Customer must be an
        active, qualified customer of Samy Bot and must be up-to-date in all payments at the time the Commission
        Fees are processed and not have been subject to a refund, credit, cancellation, suspension or
        chargeback.<br>
        5.3 Each Referred Customer must sign up in a manner, which in our sole judgment, definitively
        establishes that the Referred Customer was referred directly from you to Samy Bot under this Agreement.<br>
        5.4 Each Referred Customer must remain in compliance with our policies that are active at the time the
        Commission Fees are processed.<br>
        5.5 Commission Fees may not be paid for the Qualified Purchase if the Referred Customer has been offered
        or received coupons, refunds, credits or discounts from the Affiliate or if the Referred Customer has
        joined a business-opportunity program (as determined by Samy Bot in its sole discretion) that is managed
        or participated in by the Affiliate, unless Samy Bot has provided its prior written permission.
        <ol>
            <li>5.6 Commission Fees may not be paid if the Affiliate paid his Samy Bot membership late</li>
            <li>5.7 Commission Fees may not be paid for customers who pay their Samy Bot membership late</li>
        </ol>
        Samy Bot reserves the right to withhold initial Commissions Fees for Affiliates who are new to the
        Affiliate program, or who have commissions that are potentially fraudulent as determined by Samy Bot in
        its sole discretion, to determine the legitimacy and cancellation rates of Referred Customers.
        Samy Bot reserves the right to suspend payment of Commission Fees at any time and indefinitely, if it
        suspects fraud or other improper activity or a potential breach of any of the terms in this Agreement by
        the Affiliate or a Referred Customer(s). Samy Bot reserves the right to deduct from Affiliate’s current
        and future Commission Fees any and all Commission Fees corresponding to any fraudulent, questionable,
        and cancelled Samy Bot purchases. Where no subsequent Commission Fee is due and owing, Samy Bot will
        send Affiliate a bill for the balance of such refunded purchase upon termination of the program or
        termination of the Referred Customer.
        Samy Bot, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to withhold indefinitely any Commission Fee, and/or
        to reverse, deny or reject any Commission Fee, for:
        <ol>
            <li>A. Any account/sale which has not been in an approved status in good standing as an account of Samy Bot
                for a period of at least thirty (30) days.</li>
            <li>B. All commissions generated for accounts that may be fraudulent, including but not limited to the use
                of software that generates real and fictitious information.</li>
            <li>C. If we deem orders to be fraudulent or see a pattern of potentially fraudulent activity, including,
                without limitation, where there are multiple accounts from the same customer, or referral of accounts
                which do not comply with this Agreement.</li>
            <li> D. Referred Customers that have been offered or received coupons, refunds, credits or discounts from the
                Affiliate or for Referred Customers who have joined a business opportunity program that is managed or
                participated in by the Affiliate, unless Samy Bot has provided written permission.</li>
            <li>
                E. Affiliates whom we believe may using marketing practices that we deem to be unethical or likely to
                attract fraudulent signups and/or signups with a very low likelihood of renewal.
            </li>
        </ol>
        Samy Bot reserves the right to immediately cancel or withhold for later review any Commission Fee based
        on the foregoing or that otherwise fails to meet the Criteria. It is the responsibility of the Affiliate
        to monitor the payment, denial and withholding of Commission Fees; Samy Bot is not obligated to actively
        notify Affiliates of the status of Commission Fees. If an Affiliate has a question about a Commission
        Fee that has been cancelled or withheld, that Affiliate has 30 days from the day the payment was due to
        contact Samy Bot to discuss or reclaim the Commission Fee. Any changes to decisions about cancelled or
        withheld Commission Fees are strictly at Samy Bot’s discretion.
        Commissions for any Referred Customer who is associated with any Samy Bot reseller, referral or other
        program may be removed from your payment. In other words, You may not receive double commissions or
        compensation.
        In the event that the Referred Customers that are referred to Samy Bot by a specific Affiliate are
        determined to have an excessive cancellation rate (as determined by Samy Bot in its sole discretion),
        Samy Bot reserves the right to withhold or decline pending and future Commission Fees for the Affiliate.
        Any attempt by an Affiliate to manipulate, falsify or inflate Referred Customers, Qualifying Purchases
        or Commission Fees to intentionally defraud Samy Bot or violation of any of the terms of this Agreement
        constitutes immediate grounds for Samy Bot to terminate this Agreement and will result in forfeiture of
        any Commission Fees due to you.
        <h4>6.Commission Fee Accrual</h4>
        Commissions will accrue and only become payable once you
        <ol>
            <li>(i) provide all relevant tax and address
                documentation pursuant to Section 8 below and</li>
            <li>(ii) reach a commission level of $20 (the “Commission
                Threshold”).</li>
        </ol>
        All Qualified Purchases eligible to result in Commissions under this Section 6 must remain
        active and in good standing pursuant to the terms of this Agreement in order to remain eligible for
        accrual. Once a Commission has accrued under this Section 6, the amount of such Commission shall be due
        and payable to you under the terms of Section 7. Samy Bot reserves the right to change the Commission
        Threshold by amending this Agreement and will notify you for any such amendment pursuant to the terms of
        this Agreement.
        <h4>7.Payment Forms/Types?</h4>
        Please notify us promptly of any change in your address by updating your profile information in the
        Affiliate console.
        Samy Bot is not responsible for any third-party fees charged by PayPal, bank or other financial
        institute used to receive Affiliate Commission Fees.
        Samy Bot, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to modify the terms of this Commission payment
        method or schedule at any time. Such changes shall take effect when posted.
        Disputes: Affiliate agrees to file any commission disputes as well as any other disputes and
        discrepancies within 45 days after the end of the month in which the sale or event that is disputed
        occurred. Disputes filed after 45 days of the date on which the Qualified Purchase occurred will not be
        accepted by Samy Bot and Affiliate forfeits forever any rights to a potential claim.
        <h4>8.Taxes/Address Changes</h4>
        It is Your responsibility to provide Samy Bot with accurate tax and payment information that is
        necessary to issue a Commission Fee to You. If Samy Bot does not receive the necessary tax or payment
        information within 90 days of a Qualified Purchase which would otherwise trigger Commission Fees, the
        applicable commissions shall not accrue and no Commission Fees will be owed with respect to such
        Qualified Purchase.
        You are responsible for informing Samy Bot about changes to postal and e-mail addresses, as well as any
        changes to your name, email address, contact information, tax identification number, or other personal

        when using this Application.<br>
        Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is mandatory and failure to provide
        this Data may make it impossible for this Application to provide its services. In cases where this
        Application specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to communicate this
        Data without consequences to the availability or the functioning of the Service.
        Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the Owner.
        Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by the owners of third-party
        services used by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in
        addition to any other purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie Policy, if available.
        Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through this
        Application and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.
        Mode and place of processing the Data<br>
        <h4>Methods of processing</h4>
        The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification,
        or unauthorized destruction of the Data.<br>
        The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational
        procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some
        cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of
        this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties
        (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies,
        communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of
        these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.
        <h4>Legal basis of processing</h4>
        The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:
        Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the
        Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”),
        without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not
        apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
        provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
        pre-contractual obligations thereof;<br>
        processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
        processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
        official authority vested in the Owner;
        processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third
        party.<br>
        In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
        processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
        requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
        Place<br>
        The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties
        involved in the processing are located.
        <br>
        Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country
        other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can
        check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.
        Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the
        European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by
        two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard
        their Data.
        <br>
        If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this
        document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.
        Retention time
        Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been
        collected for.<br>
        Therefore:
        Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the
        User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
        Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long
        as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate
        interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
        The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent
        to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to
        retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal
        obligation or upon order of an authority.
        <br>
        Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the
        right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after
        expiration of the retention period.
        The purposes of processing<br>
        The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to provide its Services, as well as for the
        following purposes: Contacting the User, Handling payments, Hosting and backend infrastructure, Device
        permissions for Personal Data access, Advertising, Analytics, Backup saving and management, Content
        commenting, Displaying content from external platforms, Infrastructure monitoring, Interaction with data
        collection platforms and other third parties, Managing contacts and sending messages, Remarketing and
        behavioral targeting, Social features, Traffic optimization and distribution and User database
        management.<br>
        Users can find further detailed information about such purposes of processing and about the specific
        Personal Data used for each purpose in the respective sections of this document.<br>
        Device permissions for Personal Data access
        Depending on the User's specific device, this Application may request certain permissions that allow it
        to access the User's device Data as described below.<br>
        By default, these permissions must be granted by the User before the respective information can be
        accessed. Once the permission has been given, it can be revoked by the User at any time. In order to
        revoke these permissions, Users may refer to the device settings or contact the Owner for support at the
        contact details provided in the present document.<br>
        The exact procedure for controlling app permissions may be dependent on the User's device and software.
        Please note that the revoking of such permissions might impact the proper functioning of this
        Application.<br>
        If User grants any of the permissions listed below, the respective Personal Data may be processed (i.e
        accessed to, modified or removed) by this Application.<br>
        Approximate location permission (non-continuous)
        Used for accessing the User's approximate device location. This Application may collect, use, and share
        User location Data in order to provide location-based services.
        The geographic location of the User is determined in a manner that isn't continuous. This means that it
        is impossible for this Application to derive the approximate position of the User on a continuous basis.
        Bluetooth sharing permission<br>
        Used for accessing Bluetooth related functions such as scanning for devices, connecting with devices,
        and allowing data transfer between devices.<br>
        <b>Contacts permission</b>
